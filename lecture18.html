	<dt><img src="images/arrow.png"><span>How many countries are in Southeast Asia?</span></dt>
	<dd>There are 10 nations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</dd>

	<dt><img src="images/arrow.png"><span>Which languages are spoken in Southeast Asia?</span></dt>
	<dd>There are many more languages than nations. In Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia, the primary language is similar (Bahasa Indonesia and Bahasa Malaysia), but there are literally hundreds of languages spoken throughout the archipelago of Indonesia. Mandarin Chinese and other Chinese languages are spoken throughout Malaysia and Singapore, as well as several Indian languages. Filipino (Tagalog) and English are spoken in the Philippines. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam each have their own national languages, and of those, only Vietnam uses the Latin alphabet.</dd>

	<dt><img src="images/arrow.png"><span>What is the religion of Southeast Asia?</span></dt>
	<dd>Various religions are practiced throughout the region. Brunei,  Indonesia, and Malaysia are majority Muslim, with Indonesia being the largest Muslim nation in the world. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), and Thailand are majority Buddhist. In Vietnam, under a communist government, many people might not admit to practicing a religion, but there are plenty of Buddhist temples and Roman Catholic churches. The Philippines is mostly Roman Catholic. In Singapore, you'll find a mix of Buddhists, Muslims, Taoists, Roman Catholics, and Hindus.</dd>

	<dt><img src="images/arrow.png"><span>What foreign influences have shaped Southeast Asia?</span></dt>
	<dd>Before the 12th century CE, Indian culture and religion played a large role in many countries of the region. Chinese traders traveled by land and sea far to to west, carrying with them cuisine, building techniques, business practices. Arab traders also came in large numbers and even settled in the coastal areas. Much later, the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and British came in search of spices and other trade goods. The French came later still, making colonies of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.</dd>

	<dt><img src="images/arrow.png"><span>What are the forms of government in Southeast Asia?</span></dt>
	<dd>Thailand (which never was colonized by a European power) still has a king and an elected legislature, although there was a military coup in 2014. Cambodia is also a constitutional monarchy. Malaysia is nominally a democracy and also maintains a system of regional hereditary rulers (sultans), one of whom serves as king. Brunei is ruled by the sultan. Laos and Vietnam are communist states. Myanmar (Burma) has had a parliamentary government since 2011, after years of rule by a military junta. The Philippines and Indonesia are republics, headed by a president. Singapore is a parliamentary republic.</dd>
